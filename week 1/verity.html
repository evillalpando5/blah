    <h2 id="summaryTitle"> A Brief Summary </h2>
    <p id="summy"> Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when
        she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author
        Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his
        injured wife is unable to finish.<br/><br/>
        Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years
        of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen
        doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never
        intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's
        recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.<br/> <br/>
        Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate
        the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes
        all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted
        Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her. <p>
